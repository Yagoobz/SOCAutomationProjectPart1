<h3>Objectives</h3>
- Create a Logical Diagram 
<br />
<br />

To begin, I will create a diagram to logically map out the structure of my lab. The primary goal is to build a visual representation that helps us understand data flow and identify the necessary components to make everything work seamlessly. I will use Draw.io to create this diagram.
